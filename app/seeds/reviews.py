The color red is gorgeous and the size small is much bigger than I expected although is definitely the perfect size. Looking forward to having this bag last for years. The straps are reinforced which is great. I attached a picture of the bag in real life situation (close ups don help with actually viewing the product imo) and find it looks exactly like the picture provided by the seller. The straps have some creases, but that is expected to happen with a real leather product (it character!). Shipping took a while but hey what can you do.'))
